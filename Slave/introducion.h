Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes v. 1 Introduction

Welcome to the dangerous and challenging world of bomb defusing.

Study this manual carefully; you are the expert. In these pages you will find everything you need to know to defuse even the most insidious of bombs.
And remember — One small oversight and it could all be over!

Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes v. 1 Defusing Bombs
Defusing Bombs

A bomb will explode when its countdown timer reaches 0:00 or when too many strikes have been recorded. The only way to defuse a bomb is to disarm all of its modules before its countdown timer expires.
Example Bomb

Front	
Side
Modules

Each bomb will include up to 11 modules that must be disarmed. Each module is discrete and can be disarmed in any order.

Instructions for disarming modules can be found in Section 1. "Needy" modules present a special case and are described in Section 2.
Strikes
Strike Indicator

When the Defuser makes a mistake, the bomb will record a strike which will be displayed on the indicator above the countdown timer. Bombs with a strike indicator will explode upon the third strike. The timer will begin to count down faster after a strike has been recorded.

If no strike indicator is present above the countdown timer, the bomb will explode upon the first strike, leaving no room for error.
Gathering Information

Some disarming instructions will require specific information about the bomb, such as the serial number. This type of information can typically be found on the top, bottom, or sides of the bomb casing. See Appendix A, B, and C for identification instructions that will be useful in disarming certain modules.

Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes v. 1 Section 1: Modules
Section 1: Modules

Modules can be identified by an LED in the top right corner. When this LED is lit green, the module has been disarmed.

All modules must be disarmed to defuse the bomb.

Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes v. 1 Wires
On the Subject of Wires

Wires are the lifeblood of electronics! Wait, no, electricity is the lifeblood. Wires are more like the arteries. The veins? No matter…

    A wire module can have 3-6 wires on it.
    Only the one correct wire needs to be cut to disarm the module.
    Wire ordering begins with the first on the top.

3 wires:
If there are no red wires, cut the second wire.
Otherwise, if the last wire is white, cut the last wire.
Otherwise, if there is more than one blue wire, cut the last blue wire.
Otherwise, cut the last wire.
4 wires:
If there is more than one red wire and the last digit of the serial number is odd, cut the last red wire.
Otherwise, if the last wire is yellow and there are no red wires, cut the first wire.
Otherwise, if there is exactly one blue wire, cut the first wire.
Otherwise, if there is more than one yellow wire, cut the last wire.
Otherwise, cut the second wire.
5 wires:
If the last wire is black and the last digit of the serial number is odd, cut the fourth wire.
Otherwise, if there is exactly one red wire and there is more than one yellow wire, cut the first wire.
Otherwise, if there are no black wires, cut the second wire.
Otherwise, cut the first wire.
6 wires:
If there are no yellow wires and the last digit of the serial number is odd, cut the third wire.
Otherwise, if there is exactly one yellow wire and there is more than one white wire, cut the fourth wire.
Otherwise, if there are no red wires, cut the last wire.
Otherwise, cut the fourth wire.

Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes v. 1 The Button
On the Subject of The Button

You might think that a button telling you to press it is pretty straightforward. That’s the kind of thinking that gets people exploded.

See Appendix A for indicator identification reference.
See Appendix B for battery identification reference.

Follow these rules in the order they are listed. Perform the first action that applies:

    If the button is blue and the button says "Abort", hold the button and refer to "Releasing a Held Button".
    If there is more than 1 battery on the bomb and the button says "Detonate", press and immediately release the button.
    If the button is white and there is a lit indicator with label CAR, hold the button and refer to "Releasing a Held Button".
    If there are more than 2 batteries on the bomb and there is a lit indicator with label FRK, press and immediately release the button.
    If the button is yellow, hold the button and refer to "Releasing a Held Button".
    If the button is red and the button says "Hold", press and immediately release the button.
    If none of the above apply, hold the button and refer to "Releasing a Held Button".

Releasing a Held Button

If you start holding the button down, a colored strip will light up on the right side of the module. Based on its color, you must release the button at a specific point in time:

    Blue strip: release when the countdown timer has a 4 in any position.
    White strip: release when the countdown timer has a 1 in any position.
    Yellow strip: release when the countdown timer has a 5 in any position.
    Any other color strip: release when the countdown timer has a 1 in any position.

I'm not sure what these symbols are, but I suspect they have something to do with occult.

    Only one column below has all four of the symbols from the keypad.
    Press the four buttons in the order their symbols appear from top to bottom within that column.

This is like one of those toys you played with as a kid where you have to match the pattern that appears, except this one is a knockoff that was probably purchased at a dollar store.

    One of the four colored buttons will flash.
    Using the correct table below, press the button with the corresponding color.
    The original button will flash, followed by another. Repeat this sequence in order using the color mapping.
    The sequence will lengthen by one each time you correctly enter a sequence until the module is disarmed.

BlueYellowRedGreen

If the serial number contains a vowel:
	Red Flash 	Blue Flash 	Green Flash 	Yellow Flash
Button to press:	No Strikes	Blue	Red	Yellow	Green
1 Strike	Yellow	Green	Blue	Red
2 Strikes	Green	Red	Yellow	Blue

If the serial number does not contain a vowel:
	Red Flash 	Blue Flash 	Green Flash 	Yellow Flash
Button to press:	No Strikes	Blue	Yellow	Green	Red
1 Strike	Red	Blue	Yellow	Green
2 Strikes	Yellow	Green	Blue	Red

Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes v. 1 Morse Code
On the Subject of Morse Code

An antiquated form of naval communication? What next? At least it's genuine Morse Code, so pay attention and you might just learn something.

    Interpret the signal from the flashing light using the Morse Code chart to spell one of the words in the table.
    The signal will loop, with a long gap between repetitions.
    Once the word is identified, set the corresponding frequency and press the transmit (TX) button.

How to Interpret

1. A short flash represents a dot.

2. A long flash represents a dash.

3. There is a long gap between letters.

4. There is a very long gap before the word repeats.
If the word is: 	Respond at frequency:

On the Subject of Complicated Wires

These wires aren't like the others. Some have stripes! That makes them completely different. The good news is that we've found a concise set of instructions on what to do about it! Maybe too concise...

    Look at each wire: there is an LED above the wire and a space for a "★" symbol below the wire.
    For each wire/LED/symbol combination, use the Venn diagram below to decide whether or not to cut the wire.
    Each wire may be striped with multiple colors.

SSCDCSPBDBPSPBDC
	Wire has red coloring
	Wire has blue coloring
	Has ★ symbol
	LED is on
Letter 	Instruction
C	Cut the wire
D	Do not cut the wire
S	Cut the wire if the last digit of the serial number is even
P	Cut the wire if the bomb has a parallel port
B	Cut the wire if the bomb has two or more batteries

See Appendix B for battery identification reference.
See Appendix C for port identification reference.

On the Subject of Wire Sequences

It's hard to say how this mechanism works. The engineering is pretty impressive, but there must have been an easier way to manage nine wires.

    Within this module there are several panels with wires on them, but only one panel is visible at a time. Switch to the next panel by using the down button and the previous panel by using the up button.
    Do not switch to the next panel until you are sure that you have cut all necessary wires on the current panel.
    Cut the wires as directed by the following table. Wire occurrences are cumulative over all panels within the module.

Red Wire Occurrences
Wire Occurrence	Cut if connected to:
First red occurrence	C
Second red occurrence	B

Section 2: Needy Modules

Needy modules cannot be disarmed, but pose a recurrent hazard.

Needy modules can be identified as a module with a small 2‑digit timer in the top center. Interacting with the bomb may cause them to become activated. Once activated, these needy modules must be tended to regularly before their timer expires in order to prevent a strike.

Stay observant: needy modules may reactivate at any time.
